## Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of **artificial intelligence (AI)** designed to understand and generate human language. LLMs have become a cornerstone of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) due to their ability to analyze and produce text with a high degree of coherence and fluency.

LLMs are built on **transformer architectures** and are trained on massive datasets, allowing them to learn the structure, syntax, semantics, and even the nuances of language. These models can handle tasks like machine translation, summarization, question-answering, text generation, and much more.

In the context of **SAP Generative AI**, LLMs are integrated into various applications to automate workflows, provide insights, and create intelligent decision-making tools. These models can generate content for reports, automate customer service via chatbots, assist in documentation generation, and enable smarter business processes.
